# Bitcoin-Price-prediction

The core of the implementation utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, which are particularly effective for time-series forecasting problems like cryptocurrency price prediction.
The project involves several key components:

Data collection and preprocessing of historical Bitcoin price data
Feature engineering to extract relevant indicators from raw market data
Implementation of LSTM neural network architecture for time-series prediction
Model training and hyperparameter tuning to optimize prediction accuracy
Evaluation methods to assess prediction performance against actual price movements
Visualization of prediction results compared to actual price trends

The project demonstrates practical application of deep learning techniques in financial technology, specifically addressing the challenges of predicting highly volatile cryptocurrency markets. The implementation showcases both technical machine learning skills and domain knowledge in financial data analysis.
This work has potential applications for traders, investors, and financial analysts interested in cryptocurrency market trends and algorithmic trading strategies based on predictive modeling.
